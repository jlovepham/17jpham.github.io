     <p><br>Hello and welcome to my first produced game of the year. My partner and I worked on this through scratch. We had to change games 
      many times because some of the scripts were a bit hard to put together.</br>
      <br>The purpose of our game is to avoid the ninja stars and stay alive as long possible. 
      The game is comprised of sprites that each have their own scripts or coding. We used scripts for cloning so that it 
      duplicates the sprite to make the game harder. Other scripts that we used were for movement; using the arrow keys and space bar.
      The last thing that we coded were for buttons that wuld allow the player to start, restart, change music, and learn the game.</br>
      <br>Some of the difficulties of the game was creating duplicates. The coding was fine except for the fact that they kept going after 
      the player loses. Another difficult thing was creating the button for help. The button would interrupt and freeze the game, making it
      unplayable. The hardest part, and still has a problem, is spawning the clones. Eventually, the game gets to the poin where the person
      can longer longer staying alive, leaving a cap around 100 seconds.</br>
      <br>Shout out to Justin Nguyen for helping me with the game.</br></p>
